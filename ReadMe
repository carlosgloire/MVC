Model: This contains the business logic and interacts with the database. It's responsible for data validation, manipulation, and retrieval. Keeping database queries and interactions within the model ensures that the database-related code is encapsulated and can be easily managed.

View: The view layer is responsible for presenting data to the user. In PHP, views are typically HTML templates mixed with PHP code to dynamically generate content based on data from the controller.

Controller: This layer handles user input, processes requests, and interacts with the model to fetch data. It then passes this data to the view for presentation. Controllers should not contain database queries but instead delegate this responsibility to the model layer.

Separate Concerns: Each component (model, view, controller) should focus on its specific task and not encroach upon the responsibilities of the other components. This ensures code clarity, maintainability, and reusability.

A REAL EXAMPLE IN REAL LIFE ðŸ˜Š

Model: Imagine you're managing a grocery store. Your inventory system (the model) keeps track of all the products you have in stock, their quantities, prices, and any other relevant information. Whenever a customer buys something or new stock arrives, your inventory system updates itself accordingly. Essentially, the model is responsible for managing and organizing all the data related to your products.

View: Think of the view as the storefront window of your grocery store. It's what your customers see when they walk by or come inside. The view presents the products in an appealing way, perhaps showcasing special deals or promotions. It's all about creating an attractive and user-friendly display to entice customers to come in and explore further.

Controller: Now, picture yourself as the store manager. You're the one who interacts with both the customers (user input) and the inventory system (the model). When a customer asks about a product or makes a purchase, you handle their requests. You check the inventory to see if the product is available, update the stock levels if needed, and then inform the customer of the outcome. Your role as the manager is to coordinate between the customers and the inventory system, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

In this analogy:

*Model manages the inventory data.
*View presents the products to the customers.
*Controller coordinates between the customers and the inventory system, handling their requests and updating the view accordingly.
